### Hi there 👋

I'm Matt. I use tech to help people work together.

Software can save the world by letting us do what we do best: be human.

Here are a few of my favorite things to geek out on:
- 🤖 Machine Learning / Computer Vision
- 🌎 Distributed/Decentralized systems WebRTC, bittorrent (not crypto) 
- 📝 Collaborative editing (OTs, CRDTs, everything in between)
- 🧑‍💻 Single Page Apps (React, GraphQL)

Want to change the world? We're hiring. Reach out.
