### Hi there 👋

I'm Matt. I use tech to help people work together.

Here are a few of my favorite things to geek out on:
- 🤖 Machine Learning / Computer Vision
- 🌎 Distributed/Decentralized systems like WebRTC & bittorrent. Not crypto. 
- 📝 Collaborative editing (OTs, CRDTs, everything in between)
- 🧑‍💻 Single Page Apps (React, GraphQL)

I'm hiring. Let's work together.
